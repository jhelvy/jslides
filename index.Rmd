jslides is a theme for the [xaringan R
package](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) for making slides. It has a light tan color background with distinct coloring for code block inputs and outputs.

jslides copies ideas from several other themes, but most notably from [Allison Hill](https://alison.rbind.io/)'s xaringan styling [this workshop](https://github.com/rstudio-education/arm-workshop-rsc2019).

### Example

### Will you eventually contribute this theme to xaringan directly?

Yes, eventually, but I'm still tweaking it. Once it has all the features I want, I'll add it. In the mean time, you can include it in your
xaringan slides by adding it o the css in your YAML header like this:

```
---
title: "Title"
author: "Autor"
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: ['default', 'https://jhelvy.github.io/jslides/jslides.css']
    lib_dir: libs
    nature:
      highlightStyle: github
      highlightLines: true
      countIncrementalSlides: false
      ratio: "16:9"
    seal: false
---
```

You technically only need the line defining the css, but I put my full usual header here which also adjusts the aspect ratio and highlighting styles that I prefer.
