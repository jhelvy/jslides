### What does "λέξις" mean?

When communicating an idea to others, there is a fundamental difference between the _content_ of what is be communicated and the _form_ of how it is communicated. Aristotle phrased this as the difference between [λόγος (logos)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos), the logical content of a speech, and [λέξις (lexis)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexis_(Aristotle)), the style and delivery of a speech (see also [this article](http://rhetoric.byu.edu/Encompassing%20Terms/Content%20and%20Form.htm) on content versus form). Since the entire purpose of making a xaringan theme is to customize the _form_ of how content is delivered, "lexis" seemed like an appropriate name.
