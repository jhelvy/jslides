λέξις (lexis) is a theme for the [xaringan R
package](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) for making slides. It has a light gray background and uses [Fira Sans Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans+Condensed) for headers, [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) for body text, and [SFMono-Regular](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) for mono text (i.e. code). The theme copies ideas from several other themes, most notably from [Allison Hill](https://alison.rbind.io/)'s xaringan [workshop](https://github.com/rstudio-education/arm-workshop-rsc2019). It also uses many of the wonderful features from [Garrick Aden-Buie](https://garrickadenbuie.com/)'s [xaringanExtra](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra/#/) package.
