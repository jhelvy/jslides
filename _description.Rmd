λέξις (lexis) is a theme for the [xaringan R
package](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) for making slides. It has a light gray background with distinct coloring for code block inputs and outputs. The primary fonts are [Fira Sans Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans+Condensed) for headers, [Overpass](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Overpass) for body text, and [SFMono-Regular](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) for mono text (i.e. code). The theme copies ideas from several other themes, most notably from [Allison Hill](https://alison.rbind.io/)'s xaringan styling [this workshop](https://github.com/rstudio-education/arm-workshop-rsc2019).

### How can I use this theme?

If you'd like to use this theme, simply include the css in the YAML for your xaringan slides (see example below). You technically only need the line defining the css, but I put my full usual header here which also adjusts the aspect ratio and highlighting styles that I prefer. The `seal: false` bit drops the defaul title page - I like to make my own, like I show in my [demo slides](https://jhelvy.github.io/lexis/lexis_demo.html).

### What does "λέξις" mean?

When communicating an idea to others, there is a fundamental difference between the _content_ of what is be communicated and the _form_ of how it is communicated. Aristotle phrased this as the difference between [λόγος (logos)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos), the logical content of a speech, and [λέξις (lexis)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexis_(Aristotle)), the style and delivery of a speech (see also [this article](http://rhetoric.byu.edu/Encompassing%20Terms/Content%20and%20Form.htm) on content versus form). Since the entire purpose of making a xaringan theme is to customize the _form_ of how content is delivered, "lexis" seemed like an appropriate name.
